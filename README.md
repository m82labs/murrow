# Murrow RSS Feed Aggregator #
A simple curses-based RSS feed aggregator. This is an educational project, more advanced features will be added as I learn more. Planned features:
- Background updates
- Full-text search
- Smart sorting
- "Time-line" style view
- Notifications
- Custom tags
- Notes
- PushBullet integration (push to pocket)
- Pocket Integration (read from pocket)

For now though, you can just read the feeds. :)
